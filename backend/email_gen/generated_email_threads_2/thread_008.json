If you have the document, please upload it to the correct placeholder in the eTMF as soon as possible. If the site has not yet provided it, could you follow up with them?\n\nThis is currently holding up our periodic TMF review milestone.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSarah Chen\nTMF Specialist\nDenali Therapeutics\nsarah.chen@denalitx.com",
