      "body": "Hi Ben,\n\nHope you're having a good week.\n\nWe have a potential healthy volunteer for Part A of the DNL-123 study who is interested in screening. During the pre-screen review, we noted their liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Specifically, their ALT is 1.2x ULN.\n\nThe protocol exclusion criterion #5 states 'Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values,' but it's a bit ambiguous for this specific case. Could you please provide clarification on the acceptable range for LFTs for healthy volunteers in this part of the study? We want to ensure we are interpreting this correctly before proceeding with the formal screening visit.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMaria Garcia\nClinical Research Coordinator\nWestwood Clinical Research Center",
