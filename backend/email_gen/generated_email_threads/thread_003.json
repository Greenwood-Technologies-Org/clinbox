Can you please follow up with Sarah to ensure the deviation is documented thoroughly in the source and on the PD form? Once you receive the form, please review it and begin drafting an initial impact assessment for our internal clinical pharmacology team. We need to understand how this missing data point affects the overall analysis for this cohort.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any support.\n\nBest,\n\nMaria Garcia\nClinical Trial Manager\nDenali Therapeutics",
